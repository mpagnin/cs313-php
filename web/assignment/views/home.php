                            <h2>Something about me</h2>
                            <p id="calltofeatures">I am 58 years old. I live in Italy, not far from Venezia and Verona. 
                            They are really beautiful cities, but also Padova is avesome. Probably I tell you about it.</p>
                            <p>Since I was young, my interests split between nature and technology. I firmly believe that 
                            they can coexist in harmony. The real challenge of our time is to be able to understand that 
                            the existence of one does not prevent that of the other.</p>
                            <p>I've had a lot of different jobs. One of them was the IT manager and software developer in 
                            a very dynamic company. Then my choices led me to work in different roles (warehouse manager, 
                            sales manager, quality manager, production manager). Now, with this wealth of experience, 
                            I better understand the importance of a good use of software and of a good software to use.</p>
