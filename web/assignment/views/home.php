                            <h2>Something about me</h2>
                            <p>I am 58 years old. I live in Italy, not far from Venice and Verona. 
                                They are really beautiful cities, but Padova also is awesome. I may tell you more 
                                about it in the future.</p>
                            <p>Since I was young, my interests have been split between nature and technology. 
                                I firmly believe that they can co-exist in harmony. The real challenge of our time 
                                is to be able to understand that the existence of one does not prevent that of the other.</p>
                            <p>I've had a lot of different jobs. One of them was the IT manager and software developer 
                                in a very dynamic company. Then my choices led me to work in different roles (warehouse manager, 
                                sales manager, quality manager, production manager). Now, with this wealth of experience, I better 
                                understand the importance of a good use of software and of a good software to use.</p>
